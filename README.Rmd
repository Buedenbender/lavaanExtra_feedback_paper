Affords an alternative, vector-based syntax to `lavaan`, as well as other convenience functions such as naming paths and defining indirect links automatically. Also offers convenience formatting optimized for a publication and script sharing workflow.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `lavaanExtra` like so:

``` r
install.packages("lavaanExtra", repos = c(
  rempsyc = "https://rempsyc.r-universe.dev",
  CRAN = "https://cloud.r-project.org"))
```

## Why use `lavaanExtra`?

1. **Reusable code**. Don't repeat yourself anymore when you only want to change a few things when comparing and fitting models.
2. **Shorter code**. Because of point 1, you can have shorter code, since you write it once and simply reuse it. For items with similar patterns, you can also use `paste0()` with appropriate item numbers instead of typing each one every time.
3. **Less error-prone code**. Because of point 1, you can have less risk of human errors since you don't have possibly multiple different version of the same thing (which makes it easier to correct too).
4. **Better control over your code**. Because of point 1, you are in control of the whole flow. You change it once, and it will change it everywhere else in the script, without having to change it manually for each model.
5. **More readable code**. Because of point 1, other people (but also yourself) only have to process the information the first time to make sure it's been specified correctly, and not every time you check the new models.
6. **Prettier code**. Because it will format the model for you in a pretty way, every time. You don't have to worry about manually making your model good-looking and readable anymore.
7. **More accessible code**. You don't have to remember the exact syntax (although it is recommended) for it to work. It uses intuitive variable names that most people can understand. This benefit is most apparent for beginners, but it also saves precious typing time for veterans.

## Overview

```{r headers, results = "asis", echo = FALSE}

section.1 <- "CFA example"
section.2 <- "SEM example"
section.3 <- "Final note"

cute_cat <- function(x, header.level = 1){ 
  cat(rep("#", header.level), " ", x, sep = "")
}

cute_TOC <- function(section) {
  cat("[", section, "]",
      "(#", tolower(gsub(" ", "-", gsub(",", "", section))), ")",
      "<a name = '", section, "'/>",
      "\n \n",
      sep = "")
}

invisible(lapply(list(
  section.1, section.2, section.3), 
  cute_TOC))

```

## CFA example

```{r cfaplot}
# Load library
library(lavaan)
library(lavaanExtra)

# Define latent variables
latent <- list(visual = paste0("x", 1:3),
               textual = paste0("x", 4:6),
               speed = paste0("x", 7:9))

# Write the model, and check it
cfa.model <- write_lavaan(latent = latent)
cat(cfa.model)

# Fit the model fit and plot with `lavaanExtra::cfa_fit_plot`
# to get the factor loadings visually (optionally as PDF)
fit.cfa <- cfa_fit_plot(cfa.model, HolzingerSwineford1939)
```

<img src="man/figures/cfaplot.png" width="30%" />

```{r cfa2}
# Get nice fit indices with the `rempsyc::nice_table` integration
nice_fit(fit.cfa, nice_table = TRUE)

```

## SEM example

Note that that latent variables have been defined above, so we can reuse them as is, without having to redefine them. 

```{r saturated}
# Define our other variables
M <- "visual"
IV <- c("ageyr", "grade")
DV <- c("speed", "textual")

# Define our lavaan lists
mediation <- list(speed = M, textual = M, visual = IV)
regression <- list(speed = IV, textual = IV)
covariance <- list(speed = "textual", ageyr = "grade")

# Define indirect effects object
indirect <- list(IV = IV, M = M, DV = DV)

# Write the model, and check it
model <- write_lavaan(mediation, regression, covariance, 
                      indirect, latent, label = TRUE)
cat(model)

fit.sem <- sem(model, data = HolzingerSwineford1939)

# Get regression parameters only and make it pretty with the `rempsyc::nice_table` integration
lavaan_reg(fit.sem, nice_table = TRUE, highlight = TRUE)

```

<img src="man/figures/README-saturated-1.png" width="30%" />

```{r covariance}
# Get covariance indices and make it pretty with the `rempsyc::nice_table` integration
lavaan_cov(fit.sem, nice_table = TRUE)

```

<img src="man/figures/README-covariance-1.png" width="30%" />

```{r path2}
# Get nice fit indices with the `rempsyc::nice_table` integration
fit_table <- nice_fit(fit.cfa, fit.sem, nice_table = TRUE)
fit_table
```

<img src="man/figures/README-path2-1.png" width="90%" />

```{r indirect2}
# Save fit table to Word!
save_as_docx(fit_table, path = "fit_table.docx")

# Let's get the indirect effects only and make it pretty with the `rempsyc::nice_table` integration
lavaan_ind(fit.sem, nice_table = TRUE)

```

<img src="man/figures/README-indirect2-1.png" width="50%" />

```{r plot, eval = FALSE}
# Plot our model
nice_lavaanPlot(fit.sem)
```
